# bamazonStore


## Overview of app

In this activity, I had to create an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL Workbench and Node. 

The app takes in orders from customers, basseed on product IDs and depletes stock from the store's inventory as the orders are processed.  

This is a command line application so, aside from reading the code, here are a few pictures of the app working in action!!
